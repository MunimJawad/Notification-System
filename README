# 🔔 Real-Time Notification System

A standalone **real-time notification system** built with **Django, Django REST Framework, and Django Channels**, with Redis as the channel layer and Daphne as the ASGI server.  
This system can be integrated with any backend (like a ticketing system, eCommerce platform, or social app) to notify users instantly about important events.

## 🚀 Features

- Authentication using jwt
- Send notifications in real-time via WebSockets
- Redis-backed channel layer for scalability
- Support for multiple users and groups
- Event-driven design: Notifications can be triggered by signals
- Read/unread notifications support
- Logging for Debugging and Troubleshooting, Monitoring and Track Performance, Security and Audit.
- Easy integration with other projects

For this demonstration, I've used a **Ticketing System** with the following features:
- **Ticket List with Caching** to enhance performance

## Details 

- ** Authentication with jwt **:
  - Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to securely authenticate users and protect sensitive data. This ensures that only authorized users can access or modify ticket data. 

- **Ticket List with Caching**: 
  - Caches ticket data for each user, avoiding repetitive database queries and improving application performance. Cache expiration time is configurable.
  
- **Logging**:
  - Tracks **cache hits and misses**, **database queries**, and **errors**. Logs are stored in a log file and can also be output to the console for real-time monitoring.
